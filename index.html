                    <p>I had just finished my secondary education and i had nothing to
                        do because it would have taken me like a year before joining the
                        university for further studies.So far i have never had a work experience
                        neither self-employment nor being employed by a company.I im really
                        passionate about technology and that is why i decided to join a programming
                        class.As the years go by, the tech industry is also growing at an accelerating
                        speed.I believe that with the skills i gain for the programming class will be
                        sufficent enough for me grow as the tech industry grow and also use the skills to
                        improve the tech industry.</p>
